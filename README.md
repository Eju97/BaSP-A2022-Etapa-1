## Week 01
    On week 1, My group and I worked on the landing page of the project on Figma, plus the responsive mode por tablet and mobile.

## Week 02
    On week 2, I worked on the HTML file named after "index.html"

## Week 03
    On week 3, I added CSS styles to the HTML file, using display: block,inline-block, Float, Position, etc.

## Week 04
    On week 4, I worked on the CSS using Flexbox, to give theresponsiveness mode to the HTML file.

## Week 05
    On week 5, I have done the JavaScript exercises given, and made the correspondent changes to Flexbox.

## Week 06
    On week 6, I have added the LogIn.html file and SignUp.html files. Plus I've added validations to the LogIn, SignUp and the Contact Area using JavaScript. I also managed to do the Bonus task (Contact Form).

## Week 07
    On week 7, I have added the requests using fetch to the RR API provided. On the logIn side, if you want to get the successful validation, you must use the next email and password: rose@radiumrocket.com & BaSP2022. On the SignUp side, you must complete all the inputs with the correct data, once every input is validated, the SignUp button will make effect and to the registration proccess, getting a succesfull message alert and saving the input values into the localStorage. If you reload the page, you will get those inputs filled with the inserted values.
